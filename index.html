    <h1>Welcome to Pat's Salmon Cookies</h1>

    <p> Pat's Salmon Cookies will be the best cookie you have ever tasted.  They are the perfect morning snack to go with your coffee. You can even use them as a complete breakfast meal because each cookie contains as much protien as a whole egg without the colesterol.  How can that be true?  The secret ingredient is salmon.  Yes, salmon! The cookies are made with fresh wild salmon paste instead of flour. Through a secret process we are able to remove the fish taste from the salmon and leave all protien,omega 3 fatty acids, and vitamin D.  Because we use no flour in our cookies they are also gluten free.<br><br>You would never think these cookies are made with Salmon, and thats the point. You can satisfy your sweet tooth and get your protien to start the day. But be careful Pat's Salmon Cookies can be adictive.</p>
